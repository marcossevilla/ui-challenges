# UI Challenges

This project began with a competition between my rival from college, Elian, and me. 

We wanted to see who did the best UI code in Flutter by implementing these challenges.

Our competition now has given some content for the community, so, enjoy!

## Getting Started

This project has every challenge in its own folder if you go to `lib/src`

Make sure you get all packages before running it with

```sh
flutter pub get
```

## The Challenges

Before going through the code, you probably would want to know the UIs you'll see, so I'm leaving them to you for quick reference.
