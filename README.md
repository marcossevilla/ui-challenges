# UI Challenges

This project began with a competition between my rival from college (currently code partner), [Elian](http://github.com/elian-ortega), and me. 

We wanted to see who did the best UI code in Flutter by implementing these challenges.

Our competition now has given some content for the community, so, enjoy!

> **Disclaimer**: 
> We did this challenges with a deadline, so it's not the best code we wrote in our lives. 
> Feel free to improve the code you see here.

Also, you can check our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPz6bJ3DptMMXu7_hMb1oJQ) with Flutter videos for Spanish speakers.

## Getting Started

This project has every challenge in its own folder if you go to `lib/src`

Make sure you get all packages before running it with

```sh
flutter pub get
```
